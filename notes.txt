After teh countries declared war on each other, it stretched until 1919. At the end, Germany was defeated and the main countries that were victorious were France and Britain. The leaders of Britain, France and the USA arrived at the conference in Paris, January 1919 to sign the preace treaty in Versailles. They felt pressured to punish Germany since the vicotrious countries felt strongly that Germany was responsible for the war. During the conference, there was disagreement as to what the main aim for the conference was (GCSE BOOK). Some felt that the aim was to punish Germany, others felt that the aim was to cripple Germany so that it could not start another war, many felt tthat the point of the Conference was to reward the winning contries while some others believed that the aim of the conference should be to extablish a just and lasting peace. (GCSE BOOK) At the end, the conference was ended with the creation of fourteen points that are shown in the picture to theright.
