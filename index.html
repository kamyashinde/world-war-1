                Alliances, according to Oxford dictionaries mean a union or association formed for mutual benefit, especially between countries or organizations. During the first world war, most of the major powers were set against each other. The two alliances were the Triple Alliance, consisting of Austria-Hungary, Italy and Germany, and the Triple Entente, consisting of Great Britain, France and Russia. In 1873, Russia, Austria-Hungary and Germany formed an alliance. But, in 1878, Russia withdrew from the alliance and the dual alliance was formed (Germany and Austria-Hungary). This dual alliance was later joined by Italy to form a Triple Alliance in 1882. During WW1, Italy ended up changing sides and supported the Triple Entente. The reason why the Triple Entente was formed was due to concerns about the rising threat from the rival alliance. (Wilde)

                <h3>Germany vs Great Britain</h3>    
                Germany and Great Britain are two countries that fought against each other during the great war. For a long time, Britain felt threatened by Germany, worrying that Germany might gain more power than Britain. For instance, after the Second Naval Law was passed down in Germany, which doubled the size of the navy to 38 ships. (tutor2u) This led to the building of HMS Dreadnought (Her Majesty’s Ship) by Great Britan as they felt threatened by Germany. Building the ship was a good idea for the British since, by 1914, they remained in the lead.

                <h3>Germany vs France</h3>
                <h5>The First Morrocan Crisis</h5>
                 In 1905, France was looking to expand its colonies by making Morroco a part of the French colony. At that time, Morocco was one of the few parts that were not occupied by European powers. But, Wilhelm II of Germany did not want this to happen. Therefore, he visited Morroco and announced that he supports a free Morroco. This increased tensions between France and Germany, but in the end, France got special rights on Morroco after conducting a conference between the countries. Although the conference temporarily solved the First Morrocan Crisis, it only worsened the tensions between the Triple Alliance and the Triple Entente that ultimately led to the First World War.

                <h3>Germany vs France and Great Britain</h3>
                After the Morrocan Crisis, Germany was not happy with France gaining special rights over Morroco. Therefore, in 1911, Kaiser Wilhelm interfered with Morroco by sending rebels to attack a town. Since France had rights over Morroco, they sent aid to help with the attack. But, Wilhelm eventually accused France of the attack, due to which war preparations were made. At this time, Britain got involved and supported France since they were threatened by the Naval Law in Germany. Even though Germany backed down and the war was prevented, these events created more tension between Germany and France, as well as Germany and Great Britain.

                <h3>Balkan Wars</h3>
                Serbia wanted it to become completely Slavic, and their main ally, Russia, supported them. But, Austria-Hungary did not want this to happen. This was due to the fact that they already had a large Slavic population, and if they let it happen, the population would rebel if Serbia was all Slavs. This led to the annexation of the two countries Serbia wanted, Bosnia and Herzegovina, by Austria-Hungary.  This deeply outraged Serbia and the tensions rose steadily between them for several years. In fact, Austria-Hungary wanted to crush Serbia due to its increased size after the war. (Allan)

                After the countries declared war on each other, it stretched until 1919. In the end, Germany was defeated and the main countries that were victorious were France and Britain. The leaders of Britain, France and the USA arrived at the conference in Paris, January 1919 to sign the peace treaty in Versailles. They felt pressured to punish Germany since the victorious countries felt strongly that Germany was responsible for the war. During the conference, there was disagreement as to what the main aim of the conference was (Walsh). Some felt that the aim was to punish Germany, others felt that the aim was to cripple Germany so that it could not start another war, many felt that the point of the Conference was to reward the winning countries while some others believed that the aim of the conference should be to establish a just and lasting peace. (Walsh) In the end, the conference was ended with the creation of fourteen points that are shown in the picture to the right. Since the Treaty held Germany accountable for the First World War, it is safe to say that the treaty of Versailles played a big role in starting the Second World War. The treaty was very harsh against Germany, who at that point where doing bad with economy. More information can be found in the section under.

                    The peace treaty left Germany in chaos since many felt that Germany was to blame. In 1918, Great Britain’s Prime Minister David Lloyd - George, wanted to make Germany pay for its mistake. In 1919, the Treaty of Versailles created severe restrictions on Germany’s military strength. This left Germany feeling betrayed. This event led to the rise of Adolf Hitler and Nazism as they wished to make Germany great again. The rise of Nazism is considered one of the events that led to the Second World War.
        
                    Some people say that the assassination at Sarajevo was the reason WW1 started. But, others believe that it was rather a chain of events. But is is a good idea to wonder whether or not WW1 could have been avoided if something had gone differently in history.
